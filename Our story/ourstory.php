                <p>
                    Welcome to Food & Wine, a cherished culinary landmark in the heart of Vilnius, with a rich history
                    that
                    spans over half a decade. Founded in 2018 by Elena Dambrauskaitė, our family-owned and operated
                    restaurant was born out of Elena's deep passion for food and her dream of creating a haven for food
                    and
                    wine lovers. In 2021, Elena entrusted the legacy of Food & Wine to her close friend and business
                    partner, Jonas Vaitkus, who has since continued to uphold the tradition of warm, family-style
                    service
                    and exceptional culinary experiences.

                    Nearly six years after we first opened our doors, Food & Wine has firmly established itself as one
                    of
                    Vilnius's premier dining destinations, beloved by locals and visitors alike. We have become a
                    favorite
                    spot for both everyday guests and discerning food critics, who appreciate our commitment to
                    excellence
                    in every dish we serve.
                <div class="indent">
                    Honored by local and international media as one of the best places to dine in Vilnius, Food & Wine
                    offers an experience that is timeless, inviting, and upscale yet relaxed. Our restaurant perfectly
                    embodies the authentic spirit of European dining, with a focus on fresh, high-quality ingredients,
                    expertly curated wines, and a warm, welcoming atmosphere that makes every visit memorable.
